It attained its primary position because of its simplicity,which eases the job of the programmer, compared to earlier data models such asthe network model or the hierarchical model.In this chapter, we ﬁrst study the fundamentals of the relational model. Asubstantial theory exists for relational databases. We study the part of this theorydealing with queries in Chapter 6.

2,What is domain?,"['42Chapter 2Introduction to the Relational Modelthe two ﬁgures are the same, since both contain the same set of tuples. For easeof exposition, we will mostly show the relations sorted by their ﬁrst attribute.For each attribute of a relation, there is a set of permitted values, called thedomainof that attribute. Thus, the domain of thesalaryattribute of theinstructorrelation is the set of all possible salary values, while the domain of thenameattribute is the set of all possible instructor names.We require that, for all relationsr,t h ed o m a i n so fa l la t t r i b u t e so frbe atomic.A domain isatomicif elements of the domain are considered to be indivisibleunits.

For example, suppose as before that we include the attributephone', 'number,which can store a set of phone numbers corresponding to the instructor. Then thedomain ofphone\nnumberwould not be atomic, since an element of the domain is aset of phone numbers, and it has subparts, namely the individual phone numbersin the set.The important issue is not what the domain itself is, but rather how we usedomain elements in our database. Suppose now that thephone\nnumberattributestores a single phone number.
