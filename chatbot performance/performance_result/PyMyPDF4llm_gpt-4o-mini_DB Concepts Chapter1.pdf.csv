A major purpose of a database system is to provide users with an abstract view of the data. That is, the system hides certain details of how the data are stored and maintained.\n\n**1.3.1** **Data Abstraction**', '**1.2** **Purpose of Database Systems** **3**\n\n###### tion about you may be retrieved from a database to select which advertisements you should see.

This abstraction is achieved through a set of programs that manage data access and modification, ensuring that users can focus on the data itself rather than its physical representation. Consequently, users can perform operations without being concerned about how the data is organized or maintained.",Database system provides users with an abstract view of the data.,0.894114716628223,0.9666666666473333,0.8,1.0,0.9829607353191747
