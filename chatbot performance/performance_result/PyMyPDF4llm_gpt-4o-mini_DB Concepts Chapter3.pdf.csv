The Sequel language has evolved since then, and its name has changed to SQL (Structured Query Language). Many products now support the SQL language. SQL has clearly established itself as the standard relational database language.\n In 1986, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the Interna tional Organization for Standardization (ISO) published an SQL standard, called\nSQL-86. ANSI published an extended standard for SQL, SQL-89, in 1989. The next ver##### sion of the standard was SQL-92 standard, followed by SQL:1999, SQL:2003, SQL:2006, and most recently SQL:2008. The bibliographic notes provide references to these standards.\n The SQL language has several parts:']","SQL was originally developed by IBM in the early 1970s as part of the System R project, initially called Sequel.

Similarly, an insertion of a course tuple with a dept name value that does not appear in the department relation would violate the foreign-key constraint on course, and SQL prevents such an insertion from taking place.\n A newly created relation is empty initially. We can use the insert command\n to load data into the relation. For example, if we wish to insert the fact that there is an instructor named Smith in the Biology department with instructor id 10211 and a salary of $66,000, we write:\n\n insert into instructor\n values (10211, ’Smith’, ’Biology’, 66000);']","Data integrity in SQL can be implemented through integrity constraints defined in the Data Definition Language (DDL). These constraints ensure that the data stored in the database adheres to specific rules, such as primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints, preventing updates that would violate these rules. For example, SQL will disallow an insertion that results in null values for primary-key attributes or duplicates in primary-key values.",The SQL DDL includes commands for specifying integrity constraints that the data stored in the database must satisfy.

A subquery is a select-from##### where expression that is nested within another query. A common use of sub- queries is to perform tests for set membership, make set comparisons, and deter- mine set cardinality, by nesting subqueries in the where clause. We study such uses of nested subqueries in the where clause in Sections 3.8.1 through 3.8.4. In Section 3.8.5, we study nesting of subqueries in the from clause. In Section 3.8.7, we see how a class of subqueries called scalar subqueries can appear wherever an expression returning a value can occur.\n\n**3.8.1** **Set Membership**']","Scalar subqueries are subqueries that return a single value, typically used in expressions where a value is expected.
