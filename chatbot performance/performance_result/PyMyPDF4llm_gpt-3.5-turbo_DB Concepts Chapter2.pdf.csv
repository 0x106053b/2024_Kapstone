Suppose now that the phone number attribute stores a single phone number. Even then, if we split the value from the phone number attribute into a country code, an area code and a local number, we would be treating it as a nonatomic value. If we treat each phone number as a single indivisible unit, then the attribute phone number would have an atomic domain.\n In this chapter, as well as in Chapters 3 through 6, we assume that all attributes\n have atomic domains. In Chapter 22, we shall discuss extensions to the relational data model to permit nonatomic domains.\n The null value is a special value that signifies that the value is unknown or\n does not exist.

For ease of exposition, we will mostly show the relations sorted by their first attribute.\n For each attribute of a relation, there is a set of permitted values, called the\n domain of that attribute. Thus, the domain of the salary attribute of the instructor relation is the set of all possible salary values, while the domain of the name attribute is the set of all possible instructor names.\n We require that, for all relations r, the domains of all attributes of r be atomic.\n A domain is atomic if elements of the domain are considered to be indivisible units. For example, suppose the table instructor had an attribute phone number, which can store a set of phone numbers corresponding to the instructor. Then the domain of phone number would not be atomic, since an element of the domain is a set of phone numbers, and it has subparts, namely the individual phone numbers in the set.']","An atomic domain means that the elements within the domain are considered indivisible units.

14,How to know the primary key among the attributes of a relation in a schema diagram?,"['#### 2.4 Schema Diagrams\n\n##### A database schema, along with primary key and foreign key dependencies, can be depicted by schema diagrams. Figure 2.8 shows the schema diagram for our university organization. Each relation appears as a box, with the relation name at the top in blue, and the attributes listed inside the box. Primary key attributes are shown underlined. Foreign key dependencies appear as arrows from the foreign key attributes of the referencing relation to the primary key of the referenced relation.\n\n\n-----', 'the other attributes; for example, the dept name attribute of department is listed first, since it is the primary key. Primary key attributes are also underlined.\n A relation, say r1, may include among its attributes the primary key of an other relation, say r2. This attribute is called a foreign key from r1, referencing r2. The relation r1 is also called the referencing relation of the foreign key depen- dency, and r2 is called the referenced relation of the foreign key. For example, the attribute dept name in instructor is a foreign key from instructor, referencing depart- ment, since dept name is the primary key of department. In any database instance, given any tuple, say ta, from the instructor relation, there must be some tuple, say tb, in the department relation such that the value of the dept name attribute of ta is the same as the value of the primary key, dept name, of tb.\n Now consider the section and teaches relations.
