Each row of this table records information about an instructor,\n consisting of the instructor’s ID, name, dept name, and salary. Similarly, the course table of Figure 2.2 stores information about courses, consisting of a course id, title, dept name, and credits, for each course. Note that each instructor is identified by the value of the column ID, while each course is identified by the value of the column course id.\n Figure 2.3 shows a third table, prereq, which stores the prerequisite courses for\n each course.

2,What is domain?,"['##### the two figures are the same, since both contain the same set of tuples. For ease of exposition, we will mostly show the relations sorted by their first attribute.\n For each attribute of a relation, there is a set of permitted values, called the\n domain of that attribute. Thus, the domain of the salary attribute of the instructor relation is the set of all possible salary values, while the domain of the name attribute is the set of all possible instructor names.\n We require that, for all relations r, the domains of all attributes of r be atomic.\n A domain is atomic if elements of the domain are considered to be indivisible units. For example, suppose the table instructor had an attribute phone number, which can store a set of phone numbers corresponding to the instructor. Then the domain of phone number would not be atomic, since an element of the domain is a set of phone numbers, and it has subparts, namely the individual phone numbers in the set.', 'The important issue is not what the domain itself is, but rather how we use\n domain elements in our database. Suppose now that the phone number attribute stores a single phone number. Even then, if we split the value from the phone number attribute into a country code, an area code and a local number, we would be treating it as a nonatomic value. If we treat each phone number as a single indivisible unit, then the attribute phone number would have an atomic domain.\n In this chapter, as well as in Chapters 3 through 6, we assume that all attributes\n have atomic domains. In Chapter 22, we shall discuss extensions to the relational data model to permit nonatomic domains.\n The null value is a special value that signifies that the value is unknown or\n does not exist. For example, suppose as before that we include the attribute phone\n number in the instructor relation.

These languages are usually on a level higher than that of a standard programming language. Query languages can be categorized as either procedural or nonprocedural.

These operations have the nice and desired property that their result is always a single relation. This property allows one to combine several of these operations in a modular way. Specifically, since the result of a relational query is itself a relation, relational operations can be applied to the results of queries as well as to the given set of relations.\n The specific relational operations are expressed differently depending on the\n language, but fit the general framework we describe in this section. In Chapter 3, we show the specific way the operations are expressed in SQL.\n The most frequent operation is the selection of specific tuples from a sin gle relation (say instructor) that satisfies some particular predicate (say salary > $85,000).

Primary key attributes are also underlined.\n A relation, say r1, may include among its attributes the primary key of an other relation, say r2. This attribute is called a foreign key from r1, referencing r2. The relation r1 is also called the referencing relation of the foreign key depen- dency, and r2 is called the referenced relation of the foreign key. For example, the attribute dept name in instructor is a foreign key from instructor, referencing depart- ment, since dept name is the primary key of department. In any database instance, given any tuple, say ta, from the instructor relation, there must be some tuple, say tb, in the department relation such that the value of the dept name attribute of ta is the same as the value of the primary key, dept name, of tb.\n Now consider the section and teaches relations.
