13,What does 'atomic domain' mean?,"['We require that, for all relations r, the domains of all attributes of r be atomic. A domain is atomic if elements of the domain are considered to be indivisible units.

Then the domain of phone number would not be atomic, since an element of the domain is a set of phone numbers, and it has subparts, namely the individual phone numbers in the set.\n\nThe important issue is not what the domain itself is, but rather how we use domain elements in our database.

14,How to know the primary key among the attributes of a relation in a schema diagram?,"['It is customary to list the primary key attributes of a relation schema before the other attributes; for example, the dept name attribute of department is listed first, since it is the primary key. Primary key attributes are also underlined.\n\nA relation, say r1, may include among its attributes the primary key of another relation, say r2. This attribute is called a foreign key from r1, referencing r2. The relation r1 is also called the referencing relation of the foreign key dependency, and r2 is called the referenced relation of the foreign key. For example, the attribute dept name in instructor is a foreign key from instructor, referencing department, since dept name is the primary key of department.
