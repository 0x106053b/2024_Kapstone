In what follows, we shall see the concepts and algorithms that enable database systems to solve the problems with file-processing systems. In most of this book, we use a university organization as a running example of a typical data-processing application.\n\n 1.3 View of Data\n\n A database system is a collection of interrelated data and a set of programs that allow users to access and modify these data. A major purpose of a database system is to provide users with an abstract view of the data. That is, the system hides certain details of how the data are stored and maintained.\n\n**1.3.1** **Data Abstraction**', '**1.2** **Purpose of Database Systems** **3**\n\n###### tion about you may be retrieved from a database to select which advertisements you should see. Furthermore, data about your Web accesses may be stored in a database.\n Thus, although user interfaces hide details of access to a database, and most\n people are not even aware they are dealing with a database, accessing databases forms an essential part of almost everyone’s life today.\n The importance of database systems can be judged in another way—today,\n database system vendors like Oracle are among the largest software companies in the world, and database systems form an important part of the product line of Microsoft and IBM.\n\n 1.2 Purpose of Database Systems', '• Security problems. Not every user of the database system should be able\n to access all the data.

This abstraction provides users with an abstract view of the data, allowing them to interact with the data without needing to understand the complexities of data storage and maintenance. This is achieved by separating the logical view of the data from the physical storage details.",Database system provides users with an abstract view of the data.,0.9603006628253388,0.9266666666481332,0.75,1.0,0.48349287783648
