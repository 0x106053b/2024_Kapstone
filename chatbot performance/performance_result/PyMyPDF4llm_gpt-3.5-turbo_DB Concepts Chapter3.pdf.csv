ANSI published an extended standard for SQL, SQL-89, in 1989. The next ver##### sion of the standard was SQL-92 standard, followed by SQL:1999, SQL:2003, SQL:2006, and most recently SQL:2008.

1,How data integrity can be implemented in SQL language?,"['**58** **Chapter 3** **Introduction to SQL**\n\n#### • Integrity. The SQL DDL includes commands for specifying integrity con\n##### straints that the data stored in the database must satisfy. Updates that violate integrity constraints are disallowed.\n\n#### • View definition. The SQL DDL includes commands for defining views.\n • Transaction control. SQL includes commands for specifying the beginning\n\n##### and ending of transactions.\n\n#### • Embedded SQL and dynamic SQL. Embedded and dynamic SQL define how\n\nSQL statements can be embedded within general-purpose programming lan##### guages, such as C, C++, and Java.\n\n#### • Authorization. The SQL DDL includes commands for specifying access rights\n\n##### to relations and views.', 'SQL prevents any update to the database that violates an integrity constraint.\n\n##### For example, if a newly inserted or modified tuple in a relation has null values for any primary-key attribute, or if the tuple has the same value on the primary-key attributes as does another tuple in the relation, SQL flags an error and prevents the update. Similarly, an insertion of a course tuple with a dept name value that does not appear in the department relation would violate the foreign-key constraint on course, and SQL prevents such an insertion from taking place.\n A newly created relation is empty initially. We can use the insert command\n to load data into the relation. For example, if we wish to insert the fact that there is an instructor named Smith in the Biology department with instructor id 10211 and a salary of $66,000, we write:\n\n insert into instructor\n values (10211, ’Smith’, ’Biology’, 66000);', 'In this chapter, we present a survey of basic DML and the DDL features of SQL.\n Features described here have been part of the SQL standard since SQL-92.\n In Chapter 4, we provide a more detailed coverage of the SQL query language,\n including (a) various join expressions; (b) views; (c) transactions; (d) integrity constraints; (e) type system; and (f) authorization.\n In Chapter 5, we cover more advanced features of the SQL language, including\n (a) mechanisms to allow accessing SQL from a programming language; (b) SQL functions and procedures; (c) triggers; (d) recursive queries; (e) advanced aggre- gation features; and (f) several features designed for data analysis, which were introduced in SQL:1999, and subsequent versions of SQL.

2,What does char(n) and varchar(n) mean?,"['When comparing a char type with a varchar type, one may expect extra spaces\n to be added to the varchar type to make the lengths equal, before comparison; however, this may or may not be done, depending on the database system. As a result, even if the same value “Avi” is stored in the attributes A and B above, a comparison A=B may return false. We recommend you always use the varchar type instead of the char type to avoid these problems.', '**3.2** **SQL Data Definition** **59**\n\n#### • The security and authorization information for each relation.\n • The physical storage structure of each relation on disk.\n\n##### We discuss here basic schema definition and basic types; we defer discussion of the other SQL DDL features to Chapters 4 and 5.\n\n**3.2.1** **Basic Types**\n\n##### The SQL standard supports a variety of built-in types, including:\n\n#### • char(n): A fixed-length character string with user-specified length n. The full\n\n##### form, character, can be used instead.\n\n#### • varchar(n): A variable-length character string with user-specified maximum\n\n##### length n. The full form, character varying, is equivalent.\n\n#### • int: An integer (a finite subset of the integers that is machine dependent). The\n\n##### full form, integer, is equivalent.', '**60** **Chapter 3** **Introduction to SQL**\n\nSQL also provides the nvarchar type to store multilingual data using the\n\n##### Unicode representation. However, many databases allow Unicode (in the UTF-8 representation) to be stored even in varchar types.\n\n**3.2.2** **Basic Schema Definition**\n\n##### We define an SQL relation by using the create table command. The following command creates a relation department in the database.\n\n create table department\n (dept name varchar (20),\n building varchar (15),\n budget numeric (12,2),\n primary key (dept name));\n\n The relation created above has three attributes, dept name, which is a character string of maximum length 20, building, which is a character string of maximum length 15, and budget, which is a number with 12 digits in total, 2 of which are after the decimal point. The create table command also specifies that the dept\n name attribute is the primary key of the department relation.\n The general form of the create table command is:', '##### Additional types are covered in Section 4.5.\n Each type may include a special value called the null value. A null value\n indicates an absent value that may exist but be unknown or that may not exist at all. In certain cases, we may wish to prohibit null values from being entered, as we shall see shortly.\n The char data type stores fixed length strings. Consider, for example, an\n attribute A of type char(10). If we store a string “Avi” in this attribute, 7 spaces are appended to the string to make it 10 characters long. In contrast, if attribute B were of type varchar(10), and we store “Avi” in attribute B, no spaces would be added. When comparing two values of type char, if they are of different lengths extra spaces are automatically added to the shorter one to make them the same size, before comparison.\n When comparing a char type with a varchar type, one may expect extra spaces', '##### length n. The full form, character varying, is equivalent.\n\n#### • int: An integer (a finite subset of the integers that is machine dependent). The\n\n##### full form, integer, is equivalent.\n\n#### • smallint: A small integer (a machine-dependent subset of the integer type).\n • numeric( p, d): A fixed-point number with user-specified precision. The num\n##### ber consists of p digits (plus a sign), and d of the p digits are to the right of the decimal point. Thus, numeric(3,1) allows 44.5 to be stored exactly, but neither 444.5 or 0.32 can be stored exactly in a field of this type.\n\n#### • real, double precision: Floating-point and double-precision floating-point\n\n##### numbers with machine-dependent precision.\n\n#### • float(n): A floating-point number, with precision of at least n digits.', 'SQL also permits a variety of functions on character strings, such as concate\n##### nating (using “ ”), extracting substrings, finding the length of strings, converting ∥ strings to uppercase (using the function upper(s) where s is a string) and low- ercase (using the function lower(s)), removing spaces at the end of the string (using trim(s)) and so on. There are variations on the exact set of string functions supported by different database systems. See your database system’s manual for more details on exactly what string functions it supports.\n Pattern matching can be performed on strings, using the operator like. We\n describe patterns by using two special characters:\n\n#### • Percent (%): The % character matches any substring.\n • Underscore ( ): The character matches any character.\n\n##### Patterns are case sensitive; that is, uppercase characters do not match lowercase characters, or vice versa. To illustrate pattern matching, we consider the following examples:']","char(n) and varchar(n) are basic types in SQL. char(n) represents a fixed-length character string with a user-specified length of n, while varchar(n) represents a variable-length character string with a user-specified maximum length of n.

Other forms of the delete com- mand allow specific tuples to be deleted; the delete command is covered in more detail later, in Section 3.9.1.\n To remove a relation from an SQL database, we use the drop table command.\n The drop table command deletes all information about the dropped relation from the database. The command\n\n drop table r;\n\n is a more drastic action than\n\n delete from r;\n\n The latter retains relation r, but deletes all tuples in r. The former deletes not only all tuples of r, but also the schema for r. After r is dropped, no tuples can be inserted into r unless it is re-created with the create table command.\n We use the alter table command to add attributes to an existing relation. All\n tuples in the relation are assigned null as the value for the new attribute. The form of the alter table command is\n\n alter table r add A D;', '#### 3.9 Modification of the Database\n\n##### We have restricted our attention until now to the extraction of information from the database. Now, we show how to add, remove, or change information with SQL.\n\n**3.9.1** **Deletion**\n\n##### A delete request is expressed in much the same way as a query. We can delete only whole tuples; we cannot delete values on only particular attributes. SQL expresses a deletion by\n\n delete from r where P;\n\n where P represents a predicate and r represents a relation. The delete statement first finds all tuples t in r for which P(t) is true, and then deletes them from r. The where clause can be omitted, in which case all tuples in r are deleted.\n Note that a delete command operates on only one relation. If we want to delete\n tuples from several relations, we must use one delete command for each relation. The predicate in the where clause may be as complex as a select command’s where clause. At the other extreme, the where clause may be empty. The request', 'alter table r add A D;\n\n where r is the name of an existing relation, A is the name of the attribute to be added, and D is the type of the added attribute. We can drop attributes from a relation by the command\n\n alter table r drop A;\n\n where r is the name of an existing relation, and A is the name of an attribute of the relation. Many database systems do not support dropping of attributes, although they will allow an entire table to be dropped.\n\n#### 3.3 Basic Structure of SQL Queries\n\n##### The basic structure of an SQL query consists of three clauses: select, from, and where. The query takes as its input the relations listed in the from clause, operates on them as specified in the where and select clauses, and then produces a relation as the result. We introduce the SQL syntax through examples, and describe the general structure of SQL queries later.\n\n**3.3.1** **Queries on a Single Relation**', '**104** **Chapter 3** **Introduction to SQL**\n\n#### 3.10 Summary\n\n • SQL is the most influential commercially marketed relational query language.\n\n##### The SQL language has several parts:\n\n ◦ Data-definition language (DDL), which provides commands for defining\n relation schemas, deleting relations, and modifying relation schemas.\n\n\n##### ◦ Data-manipulation language (DML), which includes a query language\n and commands to insert tuples into, delete tuples from, and modify tuples in the database.\n\n#### • The SQL data-definition language is used to create relations with specified\n\n##### schemas.
