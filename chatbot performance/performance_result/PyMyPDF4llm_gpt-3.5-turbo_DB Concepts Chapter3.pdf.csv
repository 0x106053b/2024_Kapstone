ANSI published an extended standard for SQL, SQL-89, in 1989. The next ver##### sion of the standard was SQL-92 standard, followed by SQL:1999, SQL:2003, SQL:2006, and most recently SQL:2008.

A subquery is a select-from##### where expression that is nested within another query. A common use of sub- queries is to perform tests for set membership, make set comparisons, and deter- mine set cardinality, by nesting subqueries in the where clause. We study such uses of nested subqueries in the where clause in Sections 3.8.1 through 3.8.4. In Section 3.8.5, we study nesting of subqueries in the from clause. In Section 3.8.7, we see how a class of subqueries called scalar subqueries can appear wherever an expression returning a value can occur.\n\n**3.8.1** **Set Membership**']","Scalar subqueries are subqueries that return a single value, typically used in SQL expressions where a single value is expected. They can occur in select, where, and having clauses, and may or may not involve aggregates. The result of a scalar subquery is still technically a relation, even if it contains only one tuple.","SQL allows subqueries to occur wherever an expression returning a value is permitted, provided the subquery returns only one tuple containing a single attribute; such subqueries are called scalar subqueries.",0.9408467782885572,0.9999999999833333,1.0,1.0,0.7355173293141358
