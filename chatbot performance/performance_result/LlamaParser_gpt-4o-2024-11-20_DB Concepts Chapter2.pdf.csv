13,What does 'atomic domain' mean?,"['We require that, for all relations r, the domains of all attributes of r be atomic.

14,How to know the primary key among the attributes of a relation in a schema diagram?,"['It is customary to list the primary key attributes of a relation schema before the other attributes; for example, the dept name attribute of department is listed first, since it is the primary key.

This attribute is called a foreign key from r1, referencing r2.

For example, the attribute dept name in instructor is a foreign key from instructor, referencing department, since dept name is the primary key of department.
