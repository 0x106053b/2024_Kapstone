In practice, the data-deﬁnition and data-manipulation languages are nottwo separate languages; instead they simply form parts of a single database lan-guage, such as the widely usedSQLlanguage.1.4.1 Data-Manipulation LanguageAdata-manipulation language (DML)is a language that enables users to accessor manipulate data as organized by the appropriate data model. The types ofaccess are:•Retrieval of information stored in the database•Insertion of new information into the database•Deletion of information from the database•Modiﬁcation of information stored in the databaseThere are basically two types:•ProceduralDMLsrequire a user to specifywhatdata are needed andhowtoget those data.•DeclarativeDMLs(also referred to asnonproceduralDMLs)r e q u i r eau s e rt ospecifywhatdata are neededwithoutspecifying how to get those data.DeclarativeDMLsa r eu s u a l l ye a s i e rt ol e a r na n du s et h a na r ep r o c e d u r a lDMLs.

However, since a user does not have to specify how to get the data, thedatabase system has to ﬁgure out an efﬁcient means of accessing data.Aqueryis a statement requesting the retrieval of information. The portion ofaDMLthat involves information retrieval is called aquery language.A l t h o u g htechnically incorrect, it is common practice to use the termsquery languageanddata-manipulation languagesynonymously.There are a number of database query languages in use, either commerciallyor experimentally. We study the most widely used query language,SQL,i nC h a p -ters 3, 4, and 5. We also study some other query languages in Chapter 6.The levels of abstraction that we discussed in Section 1.3 apply not onlyto deﬁning or structuring data, but also to manipulating data. At the physicallevel, we must deﬁne algorithms that allow efﬁcient']","Procedural DMLs require users to specify both what data is needed and how to retrieve it, while Declarative DMLs only require users to specify what data is needed without detailing how to retrieve it. Declarative DMLs are usually easier to learn and use compared to procedural DMLs. However, the database system has to determine an efficient means of accessing data when using Declarative DMLs.",Procedural DMLs require a user to specify what data are needed and how to get those data.
