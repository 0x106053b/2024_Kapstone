## Project Overview
Chatbots often confuse users by producing false responses. This
 is also a reason why users are reluctant to use chatbots for learning. So we propose
 a RAG-based chatbot service named "Perfect StudyMate" that allows students to experience
 fewer hallucinations. The user uploads the '.pdf' formatted resources used in courses to the
 chatroom, and the model embeds the uploaded data and stores it in a database. Then, when
 the user asks chatbot a question related to the data, the model extracts the context related
 to the question from the embedding database and reflects it in the answer. At the same time,
 an interactive conversation is implemented by utilizing the history of conversation between
 the user and the chatbot. Users can enjoy an improved learning experience by talking to
 chatbots with less hallucination based on the content of the course material they want.
